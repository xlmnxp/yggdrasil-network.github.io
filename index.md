Yggdrasil is an implementation of a new name-independent routing scheme and functions as an end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network.

It is lightweight, easy to configure, supported on multiple platforms, and allows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with other Yggdrasil nodes. You do not need to have IPv6 Internet connectivity from your ISP â€” it also works just fine over IPv4.

The highlights of Yggdrasil are that it is:

This is still an alpha-stage project and there may be some breaking changes in the future. Despite that, Yggdrasil is generally stable enough for day-to-day use and a small number of users have been using and stress-testing Yggdrasil quite heavily for a variety of use cases.
